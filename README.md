# Botnet-Detection-and-Prevention-System

Botnet Detection System is an innovative project that harnesses the power of machine learning to predict and prevent botnet attacks on computer systems. Botnets, networks of compromised devices controlled by malicious actors, can inflict significant harm on organizations by engaging in a variety of cybercrimes, including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, spam, data theft, and more. This project offers a multi-faceted approach to identify and mitigate botnet threats, making it an essential tool for enhancing cybersecurity.

Our project utilizes cutting-edge machine learning techniques, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Hybrid Model Tree Classification, to predict and prevent botnet attacks on computer systems. By analyzing network traffic data, we can identify patterns associated with malicious botnet activities, enhancing cybersecurity and reducing the risk of cyber threats. This open-source system offers a versatile and robust solution for organizations seeking to safeguard their networks against botnet incursions.
